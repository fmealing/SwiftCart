# Minimalist Tech E-Commerce Platform 🚀

Hey there! 👋

I'm Florian Mealing, and I'm excited to share my latest project with you: **Minimalist Tech**. This is a modern e-commerce platform built for tech enthusiasts like us! Whether you're into the latest gadgets, minimalistic design, or just love shopping for tech, this platform brings it all together.

## 🌟 What's It About?

Minimalist Tech is a sleek and simple platform where users can:
- **Browse** the latest tech products
- **Add items to a wishlist** for future purchases
- **Shop recommended products** based on their preferences
- **Manage profiles** with personalized settings
- **Authenticate securely** with Supabase

This project is part of my journey to combine my love for web development and technology into something practical and fun. I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it!

## 🛠️ What It's Made Of

- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS (for that sleek, minimalist feel)
- **Backend**: Supabase (it's got PostgreSQL, Auth, and Storage baked in)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (because it's fast and easy)
