          Welcome to Minimalist Tech. I&apos;m <strong>Florian Mealing</strong>,
          a developer driven by the belief that simplicity in design leads to
          clarity in innovation. Technology should work for us, not overwhelm
          us, and that&apos;s the ethos behind everything I build.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
          My journey into tech started with the desire to create solutions that
          make life easier. Over time, I realised that the beauty of technology
          lies in its ability to simplify even the most complex challenges.
          Minimalist Tech was born from this vision: to reduce complexity,
          improve functionality, and design experiences that feel intuitive.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
          This project began as a humble front-end exercise but evolved into
          something far more impactful. Along the way, I&apos;ve learned, grown,
          and sharpened my skills as a developer. What you see today is a
          reflection of my dedication to continuous improvement and a commitment
          to building with purpose.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I believe that technology, when thoughtfully designed, can empower
          people to do their best work and live more fulfilling lives.
          Minimalist Tech is my contribution to that visionâ€”a platform built to
          serve, inspire, and simplify.
